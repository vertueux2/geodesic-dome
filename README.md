# Geodesic Dome Calculator 

Open source little calculator wrote in C++ for making geodesic dome (for now, only in the 4V Icosaedric format)
### But... Why ? 
I made this quick little project for my final year project in the IT subject.
Feel free to modify and adjust my code for your needs.

### Build it

To build the project, you need to have CMake installed on your computer. If not, download it [here](https://cmake.org/)

    cd build
    cmake .. 
    make

If you're struggling with building the project, you can still use your own build tool as this isn't a large project.

Note that this project will soonly be reconstructed.
